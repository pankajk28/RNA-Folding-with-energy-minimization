# RNA-Folding-with-energy-minimization
RNA molecule which was once consider as the intermediate step between DNA and protein has become one of the important subject of research today. And RNA folding is the most fundamental process  which underlying RNA function. RNA folding is simpler. Only four nucleotides, each made of a base, a ribose, and a phosphate, are used as building blocks of the structure but determining the RNA secondary structure from sequence data by computational predictions is a longstanding problem.
